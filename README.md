# AutismVR-A-Virtual-Reality-Based-Learning-Tool-for-Children-with-ASD-and-ID-SIH-24
AutismVR is a hybrid project combining Virtual Reality and mobile application design to support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID).

Developed using Unreal Engine, the VR environment creates immersive, safe, and structured learning scenarios to enhance cognitive and behavioral skills. A complementary Figma-based mobile app prototype enables parents and guardians to create student profiles, monitor progress, and administer a diagnostic questionnaire to assess the initial severity of autism symptoms.
